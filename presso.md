## What and how should we test?

##### In applications

- focus on end-to-end tests to eliminate human errors
- limit unit tests to bare minimum where they really make sense
- wiki-driven tests are pretty much useless for business applications
- regularly perform security tests
- make performance tests part of your life

- focus on maintainability - tests alone won't guarantee it!

## What and how should we test?

##### In frameworks and libraries

- unit tests are your friend!
- or integration tests if working on connectivity libraries
- performance is key so make it a priority
- security is usually less of a concern but don't do stuppid things
